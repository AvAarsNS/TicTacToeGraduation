# Kata TicTacToeGraduation

The graduation for the green belt requires to get back to the TicTacToe Kata (the one you developed for the 
yellow belt graduation). Do it, refactor it to make it as clean code as possible, and then wrap it within an API.
All the development must adhere to an ATDD or BDD cycle. The showcase must be performed on a Q/A
environment after having successfully tested the build into a CI environment with dedicated CI/CD pipeline.
